# What is HTTP?

[W3Schools description](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_http.asp)

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is all about communication
between clients and web servers. **Clients** are often browsers like Firefox,
but they can be any program. **Servers** are often computers in the cloud.

Communication between clients and servers is done by **requests** and
**responses**.

I always thought about it as the communication between a customer and a shop
assistant. Just imagine, you go into a shop. Suppose that you can not find
something, so you ask the shop assistant about that item. In this case, you are
the "**client**" and the shop assistant is the "**server**". Your request is,
e.g., Can I have a pack of chewing gum? In the best case, the shop assistant
hears your question, with other words he/she receive "the command". Then his/her
brain starts to process the information. After that, he grabs a pack of chewing
gum, (the flavour does not matter) and starts to hand it over to the customer.
This is the **response**. If you are lucky and the shop assistant does not throw
that chewing gum over the window, you can receive it.

In the real life it is a bit more complicated than my example.

- The browser, application, program send an **HTTP Request** to the server.
- The web server receives the request.
- The server runs the application to process the request.
- The server returns an **HTTP Response** to the browser.
- The client receives the response.

great documentation of "What is HTTP? It is more detailed than on W3Schools.
