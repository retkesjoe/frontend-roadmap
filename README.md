# Frontend Roadmap

The project goal is to go through the 2020 frontend roadmap. Actually not just
the frontend but pick up some DevOps knowledge and backend too. Also, I want to
improve my English. I use the [Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and
[Webdevelopment
Diagram](https://coggle.it/diagram/XfeRbWj7xy3dsEX8/t/web-development-in-2020)
as a guide.

Hopefully, I can commit a daily basis.

## My goals are:
- improve my English
- write some documentations
- practice, practice and practice
- learn new technologies
